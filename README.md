# 📊 Live Social Media Post Segmentation with KMeans + Explainability

**🔗 [View Live App on Streamlit Cloud](https://livedata-kmeans-randomforestclassifier.streamlit.app/)**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern brands face a core challenge: **Which social media post types truly drive engagement and ROI?**  
Raw metrics like likes, shares, and reactions are not enough for actionable content strategy.

This project provides a **large-scale, enterprise-ready AI app** that:

- Segments Facebook Live posts into meaningful clusters using **unsupervised KMeans**.
- Reveals which engagement features define each cluster.
- Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** for cluster prediction and advanced explainability.
- Provides **transparent, user-interactive explanations** with **SHAP & LIME**.
- Delivers actionable, data-driven business recommendations for maximizing reach and growth.

---

## 💡 Business Problem

Despite billions of social posts, marketers struggle to:

- Identify high-performing post types at scale.
- Trust black-box clustering without feature-level explanations.
- Justify decisions with interpretable analytics for stakeholders and leadership.

**Our solution**: A live, user-friendly dashboard offering segmentation *and* explainability, empowering confident, ROI-driven content strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Segment** posts via KMeans to uncover unique engagement patterns.
- **Explain** cluster assignments using SHAP & LIME for total transparency.
- **Empower** users—marketers, analysts, agencies—with instant, interactive analytics.
- **Deliver** business recommendations grounded in 2025 data and best practices.

  Provides feature-level explanations for individual posts—pick any row and see the drivers instantly.

- **Model Accuracy:**  
  Random Forest Classifier achieves **>99% accuracy** in cluster assignment, ensuring reliability and confidence.
